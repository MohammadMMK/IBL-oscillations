Here are the important things I found in the previous studies that discuss about the role of each mice higher order visual areas (HVAs):\

# 1) [@marshel2011]

[@marshel2011] investigate the characteristics of seven mice visual area : primary visual cortex (V1), lateromedial area (LM), laterointermediate area (LI), anterolateral area (AL), rostrolateral area (RL), anteromedial area (AM), and posteromedial area (PM).

the results reveal that mouse higher visual areas are functionally distinct, and separate groups of areas may be specialized for motion-related versus pattern-related computations perhaps forming pathways analogous to dorsal and ventral streams in other species.

(review form past :) **Dorsal Stream:** This is the "where" pathway, helping with movement and spatial awareness. **Ventral Stream:**Â This is the "what" pathway, focusing on details and object recognition.

-   (AL, RL, AM) related to dorsal stream and direction selective

-   (PM) related to ventral stream, highly orientation selective, suggesting a role in the analysis of structural detail and form in an\

This is quite interesting paper as **a)** they have used a task paradigm super close to IBL task and **B)** they inhibited AM region with optogenetic manipulation and found that AM is related to biased decisions

-   A three-port choice task was employed, where mice indicated their decisions based on varying flash rates, with careful monitoring of their behavior and adjustments made to prevent side biases.

-   Advanced techniques, including optogenetic manipulation and retinotopic mapping, were utilized to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making in the visual area AM.

-   The study establishes a causal role for the secondary visual area AM in decision-making, demonstrating that inactivation of this area biases perceptual choices.

-   These findings collectively suggest that the secondary visual area AM plays a significant role in biasing perceptual decisions, likely by influencing the directionality of choices based on accumulated visual evidence

    to be honest I am still not sure how they proved that AM is "influencing the directionality of choices based on accumulated visual evidence". Anyways, they also say that this causal influence of AM might be due to the experiment paradime and future studies is needed ...

-   lateromedial (LM) visual cortex as the mouse homolog to primate V2 (Wang and Burkhalter, 56 2007)

-   The organization of LM inputs to V1 is influenced by visual experience. This experience-dependent organization suggests that LM inputs are not static but adapt based on the visual stimuli encountered, which helps in refining the connectivity and functional properties of V1 neurons

-   LM inputs are involved in the orientation tuning of V1 neurons. The study found that visual experience leads to orientation-tuning dependent biases in the distribution of receptive field (RF) deviation angles, indicating that LM inputs help in shaping the orientation selectivity of V1 neurons

-   The study suggests that LM inputs might be involved in predictive coding, where they help in encoding learned expectations about joint LM-V1 activity. This involves distinguishing previously experienced patterns from novel ones, which is crucial for efficient visual processing and perception
