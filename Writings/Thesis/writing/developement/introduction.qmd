The International Brain Laboratory (IBL) is a collaborative research initiative that focuses on understanding the neural basis of decision-making in mice. This large-scale project involves multiple laboratories across different countries, working together to standardize and reproduce behavioral assays in neuroscience. The IBL's approach emphasizes open science, sharing data, and methodologies to ensure reproducibility and comparability of results across different research settings. By adopting a modified version of the classical two-alternative forced-choice task, the IBL investigates how mice integrate sensory information and past experiences to make decisions. This task involves head-fixed mice using a steering wheel to indicate the perceived location of visual stimuli, with the difficulty controlled by varying contrast levels. The IBL's efforts have resulted in a comprehensive dataset of 5 million mouse choices, which is publicly available for further study, highlighting the potential for collaborative studies of brain function in behaving mice
