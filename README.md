# Overview

This repository is dedicated to analyzing International Brain Laboratory (IBL) Electrophysiology datasets. It is Developed during my time at the Lyon Neuroscience Research Center (CRNL) under the supervision of Dr. Romain Ligneul (March 2024 - Dec 2024). The repository is actively evolving, with some analyses still under review by my supervisor.

### Sub-Projects (From Latest to Older)

The more recent sub-projects in this repository are structured with greater code organization and comprehensive documentation, reflecting improvements in coding practices and project management over time.
