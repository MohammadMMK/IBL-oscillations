# Right-Left Stimuli Selectivity Analysis

This project provides tools to analyze channel and cluster selectivity in response to right- or left-side visual stimuli using IBL datasets. The analysis aims to identify neural responses with selectivity based on firing rates and gamma power, using time-based comparisons across depth levels and clusters.

## Structure

### Functions

-   **compute_decodability.py**: Computes the decodability of each channel or cluster using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).
-   **firing_rate.py**: Calculates firing rates across specified conditions, time periods, and depths.

### Notebooks

-   **SpikesBasedSelectivity_OnClusters_example.ipynb**: Demonstrates a spiking-based selectivity analysis across clusters and time.
-   **SpikesBasedSelectivity_OnDepths_example.ipynb**: Demonstrates a spiking-based selectivity analysis across depths and time
-   **Spikes_based_selectivity_overall.ipynb**: Computes selectivity across multiple probe IDs (PIDs) and session IDs (EIDs) for a given list, analyzing responses across brain regions.

## Usage

### 1. Environment Setup

Ensure the IBL environment is installed and activated. (see [here](https://github.com/int-brain-lab/iblenv))

### 2. Data Extraction

Data can be loaded in two modes:

-   **Load mode**: If you have already downloaded the relevant IBL Ephys datasets, set `mode='load'` and specify the data directory with `path='path/to/datasets'`.
-   **Download mode**: If datasets are not pre-downloaded, set `mode='download'` to directly retrieve data from the IBL server (note: data is extracted but not saved to your local directory).
