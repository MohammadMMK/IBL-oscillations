# Receptive Field Mapping (RFM)

The goal of this project is to compute the receptive field maps for each channel using its gamma power and spiking activity. (more detail soon ...)

## **Usage:**

Begin by downloading the LFP data for your sessions of interest using the [Extraction project](../extraction/).  (A future update will enable direct analysis by loading data directly from the IBL server.)

Current scripts rely on parallel computation using Submitit on a server (local computation will be added soon)

This repository is developed during my work at the Lyon Neuroscience Research Center (CRNL) under the supervision of Dr. Romain Ligneul. Please note that this repository is actively evolving, with certain analyses and computations still awaiting review by my supervisor.
